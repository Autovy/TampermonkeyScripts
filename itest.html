            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>The War on College Cafeteria Trays</b><br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">A) College cafeteria food is about to get a bit tougher to take – literally.
                This
                fall thousands of students will have to navigate their university dining halls without one crucial
                feature: the
                cafeteria tray.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">B) From the University of California at Santa Cruz to Virginia Tech,
                cafeteria trays
                are disappearing, enabling universities and food-service companies to reduce food waste, lower energy
                costs and
                make college campuses more environmentally sustainable. The reasoning goes like this: When students are
                allowed
                to use trays, they tend to roam around the cafeteria grabbing food with abandon until space on the tray
                runs
                out. If you remove their trays, you make it impossible for them to carry a surplus of dishes, and they
                will make
                their selections more carefully and be satisfied with less food overall. That saves on food. Further,
                getting
                rid of trays means dishwashers have less to wash. That saves on water and energy.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">C) “Dining facilities on campuses take up to five times more water, five
                times more
                energy, five times more waste per square foot than the dorm,” says Monica Zimmer, a spokeswoman for
                Sodexo, a
                food-service company that serves approximately 600 US campuses.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">D) Exactly how much greener can a tray-banned campus get? According to a
                July report
                released by Aramark Higher Education Food Services, a dining company serving about 500 schools
                nationwide,
                students waste 25 percent to 30 percent less food when they aren’t carrying a tray, and dining halls
                save a
                third- to a half-gallon of wash water per tray, on average. The University of Maine at Farmington went
                trayless
                in February 2007, reporting an overall reduction in food waste of 65,000 pounds and 288,288 gallons of
                water
                conserved. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech – which implemented a no-tray program in response to the drought of
                2007 –
                estimated that the university saved 3,000 gallons of water per day by giving up the trays.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">E) The push for conservation doesn’t end with trays. George Mason University
                in
                Fairfax, Virginia, is at the fore of the sustainable-dining-hall campaign. In September, it will open
                Southside.
                It isn’t a cafeteria; it’s a full-service food court with takeout meals and indoor and outdoor seating –
                and no
                trays. There are several food stations to choose from – including the “Spaghettaboutit” pizza-and-pasta
                station
                and the “After All” dessert bar – and each offers its own silverware, dishes and seating area. “Without
                the
                tray, it just doesn’t give you that I need to go everywhere and fill up my tray and then sit down
                option,” says
                Denise Ammaccapane, resident district manager at George Mason. “Instead you’re saying, I like this item
                on the
                menu today. That’s what I’m going to have.”<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">F) Southside will also use eco-friendly chemical cleaners, biodegradable
                to-go
                containers, and bulk sugar and ketchup dispensers instead of disposable packets. Kitchen waste oil will
                be
                filtered and reused before being donated to biodiesel-fuel depots. “That’s how we get to as close to
                zero
                percent waste as possible,” says Zimmer of Sodexo, which provides George Mason’s dining services.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">G) Indeed, doing away with lunch trays is just one piece of a grander scheme
                to make
                dining halls and campuses carbon neutral. Schools have begun buying organic and locally grown foods, for
                example, or sometimes growing food right on campus. At the University of Maryland, there’s a tomato and
                herb
                garden atop one of the dining facilities; it was planted to generate interest in local and sustainable
                farming,
                and is watered in part using runoff from refrigerator condensation (凝结的水珠).<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">H) The green message gets broadcast in a variety of ways: at
                Claremont-McKenna
                College in California, students erected a giant pyramid of waste – a stack of styrofoam to-go containers
                –
                designed to encourage students to eat in. “Fundamentally, I think consumers have to understand that some
                of the
                responsibility lies with them to create less waste,” says Helene York, director of Bon Appétit
                Management, a
                company that has been dedicated to sustainable food initiatives at colleges nationwide since 1999. To
                York,
                eliminating cafeteria trays is just one tactic to address the issue of food waste; reducing the size of
                serving
                dishes and portions, she says, might be just as effective. As part of its Low Carbon Diet program,
                launched in
                April, Bon Appétit has challenged all 80 of its accounts to reduce food waste by 25 percent by April
                2010. The
                company provides the educational material and lets its colleges decide how it should be implemented.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I) Not every school can afford to build sustainable eateries from scratch,
                and not
                every school can even get rid of trays. Many colleges run up against common infrastructural and cultural
                barriers – such as cafeteria washroom rollers that can’t easily accommodate plates that aren’t on trays,
                or
                campus residents who just can’t get on board with a tray-free lunch. At some schools, like Middlebury in
                Vermont, trays were simply removed, and administrators let the grumbling subside. But at most other
                colleges,
                the movement has been grounded in community discussion on sustainability concepts – so students and
                faculty are
                on board with the idea. Says Chris Stemen, senior director of sustainability and environmental
                stewardship
                (管理工作) at Aramark: “Part of why you’re at college is for the learning environment – new mindset, new
                habits, new
                ideas.”</p>
